# Fibonacci Numbers

With this project, I learned how to get user input, parse it, and see how the programming concepts (like variables, data types, functions, if expressions, and loops) I've learned so far translate to Rust.

## What's Inside?

- **Generate Fibonacci Sequence**: Create a sequence of n Fibonacci numbers.
- **Get nth Fibonacci Number**: Retrieve the nth Fibonacci number with ease.
